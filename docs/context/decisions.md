## Current Governance Baseline Decisions

### 2026-05-10 — Separate runtime AI autonomy from development-agent autonomy

- Decision: Runtime AI inside DiamondDust may only generate candidates, relations, patches, drafts, and reports; the coding agent may autonomously plan, edit code/docs, test, review, and propose changes within the active task scope.
- Reason: The product safety boundary must prevent direct AI mutation of formal knowledge, while development work still needs agent autonomy to move efficiently.
- Alternatives: Treat all AI autonomy as forbidden until patch review is stable; allow runtime AI to mutate formal notes directly.
- Risks: The distinction must remain explicit so future product features do not inherit development-agent freedoms.
- Follow-up: Keep runtime AI write behavior behind validated patch review and user acceptance.

### 2026-05-10 — Use project docs as DiamondDust source of truth

- Decision: DiamondDust-specific product facts, architecture boundaries, schemas, review gates, and governance decisions live in `docs/`; `AGENTS.md` remains the navigation and operating-control plane.
- Reason: This keeps durable project context in the repository and avoids relying on chat history.
- Alternatives: Put all governance in `AGENTS.md`; encode project facts in reusable skills; rely on external issue history.
- Risks: Docs can drift from implementation if not updated during behavior, schema, or architecture changes.
- Follow-up: Update docs and repo memory whenever public behavior, schema, architecture, workflow, or policy changes.

### 2026-05-10 — Use skills for reusable workflows only

- Decision: Skills may define repeatable workflows such as planning, milestone review, debugging, PR review, and escalation, but must not duplicate or override DiamondDust product truth.
- Reason: Skills should improve agent process without becoming a competing authority for project-specific facts.
- Alternatives: Store project governance in skills; avoid skills entirely.
- Risks: A stale skill could conflict with project docs.
- Follow-up: Prefer project docs in conflicts and create an escalation request if following a skill would reduce delivery quality.

### 2026-05-10 — Require execution plans and repo memory for non-trivial tasks

- Decision: Non-trivial work requires an execution plan under `docs/exec-plans/active/`, durable context updates under `docs/context/`, and completed-plan compression under `docs/exec-plans/completed/`.
- Reason: The project needs continuity across context compression, review cycles, and future agent sessions.
- Alternatives: Use chat-only plans; use ad hoc notes outside the repo.
- Risks: Planning overhead can grow if plans include raw logs or speculative detail.
- Follow-up: Keep plans concise, revise them when evidence changes, and avoid persisting temporary debugging noise.

### 2026-05-10 — Keep implementation behind review gates

- Decision: Product implementation code should wait until startup governance and architecture docs are approved and the relevant review gates are satisfied.
- Reason: The MVP depends on safety-critical boundaries around schema validation, patch review, formal writes, and provider neutrality.
- Alternatives: Begin product code before Gate 0/Gate 1 approval; mark gates passed without review.
- Risks: Delaying implementation can slow visible progress.
- Follow-up: Ask the product owner to review startup docs and decide whether Gate 0 and Gate 1 can be marked passed.

### 2026-05-10 — Initialize minimal governance skills under `skills/`

- Decision: Create lightweight repo-local governance skills for planning, escalation, milestone review, PR review, and Git workflow under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Reason: The product owner approved initializing minimal governance skills, and the workspace `.codex/` and `.agents/` directories are read-only.
- Alternatives: Use hidden `.codex/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` directories; create scripts/assets/references; keep the workflows only in docs.
- Risks: `skills/` may require later wiring if the active Codex environment discovers only a different skill path.
- Follow-up: Confirm or document the skill discovery path when repo-local skill loading becomes necessary.
